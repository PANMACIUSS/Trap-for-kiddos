# Trap for kiddos
This is the trap for kiddos. It looks lite normal League of Legends shortcut, but if the kiddos runs the program, it displays a fake blue screen, that instantlery triggers a teacher, and shutsdown the computer.


# How to setup everything:
1. First download the files and extract the zip file.
2. Then place all of this files in folder where anyone can't find it. For example in Picture folder in windows
3. Set folder as hidden and turn off hidden items in windows file explorer
3. Make a shortcut from League of Legends file and drap and drop in to desktop and change the name to "Leauge of Legends"
4. For the first time run the program, windows defender could block the proces but simply click run and on the next time alert from windows defender will not appear.
